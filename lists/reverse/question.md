## Question 1: Reverse a Linked List (Full Program) ##

Write a complete program that:

**1)** Defines a singly linked list node (struct Node).

**2)** Implements a function insertEnd to add new nodes to the list.

**3)** Implements a function printList to display the list.

**4)** Implements a function reverseList that reverses the list in place.

**5)** In main, build a list with the numbers 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5, print it, call reverseList, and print the reversed list.
